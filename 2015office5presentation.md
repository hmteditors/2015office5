Ἕκτορι μὲν καὶ Τρωσὶ τὸ, ἀντωνυμία μὲν ὁμολογουμένως τὸ τό μόριον οὐ μὴν διασταλτέον καταυτὸ ὡς ἔδοξε τισίν

"'To Hector and the Trojans this', the particle 'τό' is a pronoun widely agree upon. However, one should not pause after each as some have thought."

1. What is the relation between the two sentences? 
1. What were τινες thinking?!

##A close parallel##

Iliad book 1 line 396: πολλάκι γάρ σεο πατρὸς ἐνὶ μεγάροισιν ἄκουσα

"For often I have heard you in my father's palace"

![scholion2b][img5]

βραχὺ δὲ **διασταλτέον** μετὰ **τὴν ἀντωνυμίαν**· τὸ γὰρ ἑξῆς ἐστι, πολλάκι γάρ σου ἤκουσα

"One ought to pause briefly after the pronoun; for the construction runs as follows: 'for often have I heard you'"

##Back to our scholion: some conclusions##

1. point of the first sentence of the scholion: τό κέρδιον needs to be parsed NOT as one wordgroup but as subject and predicate
1. the main text helps the performer by providing periods before and after τό
1. point of the second sentence of the scholion: doesn't mistake the dots in the main text for punctuation marks!
1. τινες don't necessarily be grammarians but may be casual readers

##Implications and Future Directions##

- further insight into the use of periods in the Venetus A text
- potential insight into how the Iliad text was used in Alexandrian times
- further directions: a systematic inquiry into how periods are used, how grammatical terms such as διαστέλλω are used
